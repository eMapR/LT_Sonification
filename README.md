This folder contains the starting point for sonification. A way to convert data in to sound. Peder N was 
thinking of using a LandTrendr Time Series to make such sounds. According to the link Peder provided it
seems pretty straight forward. (https://medium.com/@astromattrusso/sonification-101-how-to-convert-data-into-music-with-python-71a6dd67751c).
So, I'll try to get this setup with a simple test from the link above. 

This looks like it runs from just python using a csv of data. 

	Python packages :

		Pandas
		Matplotlib
		audiolazy
		midiutil
		pygame
